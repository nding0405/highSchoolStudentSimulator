# My Personal Project

## Project Description
#### 1. What will the application do?
- The application is a game called **student simulator**. 
Gamers are expected to add activities(can be either courses or games) for a high school
student. Every course and game has 3 basic index: **time, pressure index
and knowledge index**. Once the total time in the schedule exceeds a specific value 
as the user keeps adding courses and games, the student will go to different universities
based on the total knowledge and pressure he/she accumulated. Or the student will drop
the school if the pressure index in total exceed an assigned value. 


#### 2. Who will use it?
- Targeted users are anyone who would like to try this **simple multi-ending game**.

#### 3.Why is this project of interest to me?
- A multi-ending game is of interest to me and it will be fun to play with it.
